# **A Micro Blogging App powered by the WP REST API**

### Description 
This is an example of utilizing the WP REST API to create an interactive application. It allows you to:
1. Create a post
2. Update a post
3. Delete a post
4. Display all posts

### Exercise
The /start/ folder consists an incomplete index.js file inside /assets/js. There are 4 TO-DO items: 
1. Insert AJAX call to **RETRIEVE** all posts via the WP REST API
2. Insert AJAX call to **CREATE** post via the WP REST API
3. Insert AJAX call to **DELETE** post via the WP REST API
4. Insert AJAX call to **UPDATE** post via the WP REST API

The /end/ folder consists of the completed index.js so feel free to refer to that if you are stuck

### Note
Remember to change  ``const url = ...`` in **line 1** to your site address
